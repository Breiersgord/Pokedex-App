# Achievement 1 Project: JavaScript APP (Pokedex)

### The Pokedex (project brief)
The end goal, which can be seen now as a GitHub Page, was to create a functional, user friendly, and aesthetically pleasing Pokedex. A Pokedex (coined from the popularized anime * *'Pokemon'* *) is a device used to view Pokemon and their stats on both an individual and large scale basis. I've replicated the idea in webpage form allowing users to become their OWN Pokemon Trainers in the sense that they can look up and see not only the stats, but the image of any of the first 150 Pokemon. 

### Dependencies
In order to accomplish this, I utilized a few different coding strategies and methods taught throughout our project creation phase. The pokemon, their stats, images, etc. draw from an API (please see the bottom of this file for all outsourced materials used), and the functionality of the webpage or the 'pokedex' is largely thanks to Bootstrap. A few creative choices were made to help keep the theme consitent (color choices and fonts especially), but the utilization of a modal and search function really pull the idea of this being a functional Pokedex together. 

### A Word for Future Pokemon (and Coding) Masters
While I am happy with the end result, I caution all new coders to remember to double and triple check their spelling and capitalization on ALL projects current and future. Many errors I ran into were a result of small oversights like these, and I am grateful for the mentor I had behind me to help me catch them. Just like Pokemon, You * *"Gotta catch 'em all!"* * if you want your project to funtion and look as intended.
